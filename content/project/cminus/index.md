title: CMinus Compiler
summary: |2-

    * We implemented a Compiler for CMinus Langauge, a simplified subset of the C language.


    * It consists of four parts: Lexer, Parser, Code Generator, and Semantic Analyzer.

    * The compiler is written using only **Python** and its standard libraries.

    * The Compiler's speed was tested using Ackermann test.

    * The course in which we did this project was taught by **Dr. Gholamreza Ghassem-Sani** at Sharif University of Technology.
