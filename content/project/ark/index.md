title: Ark

summary: |2-
    * Ark is a VPN protocol wich tries to obfuscate network traffic
    by swapping network protocol between TCP and UDP
    to stay hidden in the eyes of the adversary

    * Ark re-implements the TCP protocol on the client systems and send TCP data via UDP protocol and vise versa.
    * Doing so, the input and output traffic of the server node are no longer of the same protocol and the server node
    can stay hidden from the eyes of the adversarial agent in the network.
    * for more information check the code repo.

    * This was my thesis project and i worked on different layers of network and did manual packet parsing and re-implemented
    the TCP stack to better fit Ark's customize needs.

    * The thesis project was suppervised by **Dr. Mahdi Jafari Siavoshani** at Sharif University of Technology.
