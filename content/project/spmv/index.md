title: Sparse-Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV)
summary: |2-
    * Optimized Sparse-Matrix Vector Multiplication using different parallelism and concurency methods.
    * I developed SpMV method using the following different framework:
        * multi threading
        * OpenMP
        * Rayon-rs
        * Vector processor (intel AVX-2)
        * SIMD (using Cuda on Nvidia GPU)
    * Since each approach takes a different prespective to the problem,
    a different set of algorithm and data structure was needed to achieve peak performance in each senario.
    As part of the task, I studied and implemented a variety of solutions proposed in defferent researches and evaluated their performance.
