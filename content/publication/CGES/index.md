abstract: We are currently developing novel algorithms for explainable rational synthesis in multi-agent systems (MAS) with Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) objectives. Our work addresses the challenge of computing Nash equilibrium strategies in concurrent graph games, a problem known for its double-exponential complexity. I have created a compositional approach that enhances the performance and explainability of rational synthesis by converting the game into a suspect game, solving it as a parity game, and optimizing strategies for multi-agent coordination. Additionally, my research includes the practical implementation of a tool that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LTL synthesis methods in various case studies, with a focus on improving system performance and understandability in applications such as autonomous systems and robotics.
