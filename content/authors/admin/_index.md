I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.
I’ve worked as a Data Platform engineer at Digikala, the largest e-commerce platform in the Middle East,
and currently serve as a software engineer at Sotoon, where we provide distributed cloud solutions.

My research interests focus on parallel computing, distributed systems, programming languages, verification, and operating systems.
I'm particularly passionate about utilizing Rust for safer code through compile-time guarantees and exploring WebAssembly's role in cloud environments.
